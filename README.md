Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are valuable resources through which one can harness more efficient and productive processes enabling a safer, more reliable transition to 100% green energy. In America, the department of energy (DOE) has partnered with IBM to develop ML and AI models which can better predict weather reports essential for driving solar and wind farms. Currently, companies who have benifited from using AI and ML include ABB, Shell, BP, Exxon mobil, Google and Deepmind to name a few. Countries focusing on AI in engineering and renewables include Australia, USA, India, Italy, China and U.K with total investment of $8 billion by the end of 2024.
 
An example for predicting materials using data analytics and high throughput machine learning models to resemble properties of the first generation solar cells can be found in this article (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b01025).

At a micro-grid scale, AI can be used by operators to mitigate bottlenecks in the grid and decide whether energy should be stored in a battery, distributed, or sold in an electricity exchange at a particular location and moment of time resulting in greater energy consumption efficiency.
